Lower Bound-STL. One commit is without using lower_bound function because I had to figure it out, to understand it better.. aka as a challenge. It does not pass a few tests due to time inefficiency. Without using lower_bound function the time is O(b * n).  That is why you need to use Lower_Bound(). It reduces the big O to O(b * logn) because it is performing binary search.
